# PROGRAM 2 FOR ECS 122B <br />
### WINTER QUARTER 2018 <br />
### PROFESSOR GYSEL <br />

##### Program Description: <br />
Implementation of Random Matrix Hash. Generate a random matrix with each index randomly 0 or 1. <br />
Take a given integer key, turn it into binary array, apply matrix multiplication, result is the key within the table. <br />

Bloom Filter implementation with arrays and relying on random matrix hash. Insert individual, Insert Set, Query functions have been established. <br />

##### Tests:
Random Matrix Hash Uniform Generation: Working <br />
Random Matrix Hash Roughly Equal Access: Working <br />
Bloom Filter No False Negatives: Working <br />
Bloom Filter Low False Positives: Working, changed values <br />
